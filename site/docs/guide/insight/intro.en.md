A module for automatically discovering interesting patterns from multi-dimensional data.

</div>

## ‚ú® Features

* **Auto-Insights**: Automatically detect and highlight the insights to facilitate pattern discovery about the data.
* **Visualization & Annotation**: Clearly represent and convey insights to non-expert users.
* **Homogeneous Data Patterns**: Extract the relations between different patterns.

The pipeline of Auto-Insights:

## üî® Usage


```ts
import { getInsights } from '@antv/ava';

getInsights(data, {
  limit: 30,
  measures: [
    { fieldName: 'life_expect', method: 'MEAN' },
    { fieldName: 'pop', method: 'SUM' },
    { fieldName: 'fertility', method: 'MEAN' },
  ]
});
```

## üîç Custom Insight Types
There are 7 types of insights, and extractors is defined by the  ***insightTypes*** attribute. By default, each and every extractor will be executed.
```ts
import { getInsights } from '@antv/ava';

getInsights(data, {
  limit: 10,
  insightTypes: ['trend', 'time_series_outlier']
});
```

Optional insight types: 
* `trend `ÔºöDetect significant increases or decreases in time series. Use [Mann-Kendall test](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/trend/vignettes/trend.pdf#page=2).

* `change_point `ÔºöDetect change points in time series. Use [Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.3742.pdf).

* `majority `ÔºöDetect the outstanding indicators of data by setting proportion limits.

* `low_variance `ÔºöDetect the uniformity and determine if data points are distributed around the mean value by calculating [coefficient of variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation).

* `category_outlier `ÔºöDetect category outliers in the data by calculating [IQR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQR).

* `time_series_outlier `ÔºöDetect outlier points in time series by [STL decomposition](https://otexts.com/fpp2/stl.html).

* `correlation`ÔºöDetect if there is a correlation between two sequences of data by calculating [Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient).
